                                        <p>Hermetas provides a range of services targeting student governments (ASO's) of the California Community College system. We have found that ever year students must relearn what was learned by their previous administration. Hermetas is here to streamline
                                            this re-learning process. We provide training and consultation on California's Open Meetings Laws, Parliamentary Procedure, and Robert's Rules of Order, as well as IT services to fit student government's specific needs.</p>
                                        <p>All partners and associates of Hermetas have had personal experience in Student Government and share the passion that comes from empowering the future. Please contact us if you have any questions.</p>

        <div class="col-10 media-body text-center text-md-left ml-md-3 ml-0">
          <h2 class="mt-0">Aaron Lee Taggert, PRP CC</h2>
          <p class="drop-cap">Aaron Taggert was President of Student Government for Cerro Coso Community College in 2011-2012 and Communications Officer before that. During his service Aaron found his true love, Robert Rules, and learned about the Ralph M. Brown Act. Aaron's now
            deceased grandmother taught him to question and research everything. "Trust, but verify" is one of Aaron's favourite quotes and because of this philosophy he discovered many inconstancies between state law and district policy. He then had the great fortune
            to run into John Fraser. John Fraser has a similar love of mischief combined with a heart big enough to want to do what it takes to create the society we all want to live in. John and Aaron were instrumental in the <strong>Vote of No Confidence</strong> in
            Pasadena City College's Administration. A joke was made that they should charge for all the work that they do and thus Hermetas was born. Bonnie Moir was brought to the SGCC Office and told to sign a paper. After signing she asked what this was all about.
            Aaron told her that she was now in student government. She reluctantly grew to love student government and Robert's Rules. She was made a partner of Hermetas later because of her organizational skills and her grounded outlook and most importantly, her
            willingness to put up with John and Aaron.</p>
          <h4> Aaron's Noted Accomplishments: </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Received Comptetent Communicator Award from <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/">Toastmasters International</a>. Communication competence is the ability to choose a communication behavior that is both appropriate and effective for a given situation. Competent communicators express a concise, easily comprehensible message, understand
              the recipients of their message, possess empathy for those recipients and practice active listening. Strong communication skills are important for both personal and professional success.</li>
            <li>Earned Credental as a Registered Parliamentarian. A parliamentarian is a professional consultant who advises an organization, its leaders, members, committees and staff on parliamentary law and proper procedure for conducting meetings. A Registered Parliamentarian
              is a professional designation given by the <a href="http://www.parliamentarians.org/">National Association of Parliamentarians</a>and demonstrates an in-depth knowledge of parliamentary procedure and a thorough familiarity with Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised. This knowledge helps RPs provide quality instruction to others learning
              about parliamentary procedure; enables them to respond quickly and confidently to questions and situations that arise during the conduct of business in the organizations they serve or in which they participate; and allows them to quickly find details
              or supporting documentation of any parliamentary topic.</li>
            <li>Serves as the Chair of the Religious Explorations Committee of his church.</li>
            <li>Serves as the <a href="https://d2tm.org">District 2 Parliamentarian</a>for <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/">Toastmasters International</a> </li>

                                                        the application of this Severability provision should materially and adversely affect the economic substance of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Party adversely impacted shall be entitled to compensation for such adverse impact, provided the
                                                        reason for the invalidity or unenforceability of a term is not due to serious misconduct by the Party seeking such compensation.</li>
